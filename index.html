            <h1>From Ratings to Revenue: 2024 in Movies</h1>
            <p>Do better movies generate more money?</p>
            <p><strong>Short answer: not exactly—critical favorites and box office giants rarely line up.</strong></p>
            <p>
                Every year, hundreds of films are released. Some are box office giants, while others barely earn any
                money.
            </p>
            <p>
                This analysis of 199 movies released in 2024 examines what connects popularity with perception. Do the
                movies loved by IMDb end up making the most money? Or does success follow a different path?
            </p>
            <p>Here’s the year, week by week.</p>

                As the year got closer to the holiday season (and awards season), the releases increase. In the second
                half of 2024, <strong>more than 70% of the movies were released, earning a combined $10.5
                    billion.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Let’s compare both categories.</p>

            <section class="centered-paragraph">
                <p>There's not a lot of similarities between both charts, but it's worth mentioning that most of the
                    movies with higher scores have low number of reviews due to their niche (<em>Attack on Titan</em>
                    and <em>Solo Leveling</em> have less
                    than 12,000 and 5,000, respectively). </p>
                <p>Other movies that are very well reviewed are not American: <em>Maharaja</em> and <em>Amaran</em>, for
                    example, are from
                    India, and both, while having very successful home releases, didn't feature heavily in US theaters,
                    limiting the average IMDb reviewer's exposure to them. </p>
                <p><em>Dune: Part Two</em> is a rare overlap: it appears in both top 10 lists and has the highest number
                    of user ratings in this dataset, making it the most widely rated 2024 release on IMDb.</p>
